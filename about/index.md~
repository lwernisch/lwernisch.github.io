I am a programme leader at the Medical Research Council
[Biostatistics
Unit](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/n-to-s/lorenz-wernisch/)
at Cambridge University. Before joining the BSU in 2007 I taught at [Birkbeck College](http://www.bbk.ac.uk/), University of London. My first research position in the UK was at the [EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/).

## Other interests

Violin playing (in string quartets and [string orchestras](https://vimeo.com/223593540)), [photography](http://lorenzwernisch.org/photography), [video](https://vimeo.com/manage/albums/3071976). I also dabble in EDM music production. A recent passion is flying, particularly an [aerobatics plane](https://cambridgeaeroclub.com/extra-ea-200/) at the Cambridge Aeroclub. Gym, Volleyball, some windsurfing and skiing to get the circulation going after much sitting.
