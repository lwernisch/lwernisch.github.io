  abstract: A common class of behaviour encountered in the biological sciences involves
    branching and recombination. During branching, a statistical process bifurcates
    resulting in two or more potentially correlated processes that may undergo further
    branching; the contrary is true during recombination, where two or more statistical
    processes converge. A key objective is to identify the time of this bifurcation
    (branch or recombination time) from time series measurements, e.g. by comparing
    a control time series with perturbed time series. Gaussian processes (GPs) represent
    an ideal framework for such analysis, allowing for nonlinear regression that includes
    a rigorous treatment of uncertainty. Currently, however, GP models only exist
    for two-branch systems. Here, we highlight how arbitrarily complex branching processes
    can be built using the correct composition of covariance functions within a GP
    framework, thus outlining a general framework for the treatment of branching and
    recombination in the form of branch-recombinant Gaussian processes (B-RGPs).

  abstract: A number of pseudotime methods have provided point estimates of the ordering
    of cells for scRNA-seq data. A still limited number of methods also model the
    uncertainty of the pseudotime estimate. However, there is still a need for a method
    to sample from complicated and multi-modal distributions of orders, and to estimate
    changes in the amount of the uncertainty of the order during the course of a biological
    development, as this can support the selection of suitable cells for the clustering
    of genes or for network inference.

  abstract: Integrated analysis of multiple genome-wide transcription factor (TF)-binding
    profiles will be vital to advance our understanding of the global impact of TF
    binding. However, existing methods for measuring similarity in large numbers of
    chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with sequencing (ChIP-seq), such as correlation,
    mutual information or enrichment analysis, are limited in their ability to display
    functionally relevant TF relationships. In this study, we propose the use of graphical
    models to determine conditional independence between TFs and showed that network
    visualization provides a promising alternative to distinguish ’direct’ versus
    ’indirect’ TF interactions. We applied four algorithms to measure ’direct’ dependence
    to a compendium of 367 mouse haematopoietic TF ChIP-seq samples and obtained a
    consensus network known as a ’TF association network’ where edges in the network
    corresponded to likely causal pairwise relationships between TFs. The ’TF association
    network’ illustrates the role of TFs in developmental pathways, is reminiscent
    of combinatorial TF regulation, corresponds to known protein-protein interactions
    and indicates substantial TF-binding reorganization in leukemic cell types. With
    the rapid increase in TF ChIP-Seq data sets, the approach presented here will
    be a powerful tool to study transcriptional programmes across a wide range of
    biological systems.

  volume: '13'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: Integrative clustering is used to identify groups of samples by jointly
    analysing multiple datasets describing the same set of biological samples, such
    as gene expression, copy number, methylation etc. Most existing algorithms for
    integrative clustering assume that there is a shared consistent set of clusters
    across all datasets, and most of the data samples follow this structure. However
    in practice, the structure across heterogeneous datasets can be more varied, with
    clusters being joined in some datasets and separated in others. In this paper,
    we present a probabilistic clustering method to identify groups across datasets
    that do not share the same cluster structure. The proposed algorithm, Clusternomics,
    identifies groups of samples that share their global behaviour across heterogeneous
    datasets. The algorithm models clusters on the level of individual datasets, while
    also extracting global structure that arises from the local cluster assignments.
    Clusters on both the local and the global level are modelled using a hierarchical
    Dirichlet mixture model to identify structure on both levels. We evaluated the
    model both on simulated and on real-world datasets. The simulated data exemplifies
    datasets with varying degrees of common structure. In such a setting Clusternomics
    outperforms existing algorithms for integrative and consensus clustering. In a
    real-world application, we used the algorithm for cancer subtyping, identifying
    subtypes of cancer from heterogeneous datasets. We applied the algorithm to TCGA
    breast cancer dataset, integrating gene expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation
    and proteomics. The algorithm extracted clinically meaningful clusters with significantly
    different survival probabilities. We also evaluated the algorithm on lung and
    kidney cancer TCGA datasets with high dimensionality, again showing clinically
    significant results and scalability of the algorithm.

  abstract: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a human pathogen that is a major cause of

    provide an effective method for molecular serotyping. Previously we developed
    an empirical Bayesian model for the classification of serotypes from a molecular
    serotyping array. With only few samples available, a model driven approach was
    the only option. In the meanwhile, several thousand samples have been made available
    to us, providing an opportunity to investigate serotype classification by machine
    learning methods, which could complement the Bayesian model.

  abstract: Repeated cross-sectional time series single cell data confound several

    these effects can be estimated and corrected for under certain smoothness assumptions
    on cell progression.

  abstract: Inferring gene regulatory relationships from observational data is challenging.
    Manipulation and intervention is often required to unravel causal relationships
    unambiguously. However, gene copy number changes, as they frequently occur in
    cancer cells, might be considered natural manipulation experiments on gene expression.
    An increasing number of data sets on matched array comparative genomic hybridisation
    and transcriptomics experiments from a variety of cancer pathologies are becoming
    publicly available. Here we explore the potential of a meta-analysis of thirty
    such data sets. The aim of our analysis was to assess the potential of in silico
    inference of trans-acting gene regulatory relationships from this type of data.
    We found sufficient correlation signal in the data to infer gene regulatory relationships,
    with interesting similarities between data sets. A number of genes had highly
    correlated copy number and expression changes in many of the data sets and we
    present predicted potential trans-acted regulatory relationships for each of these
    genes. The study also investigates to what extent heterogeneity between cell types
    and between pathologies determines the number of statistically significant predictions
    available from a meta-analysis of experiments.

  abstract: Despite major advances in the generation of genome-wide binding maps,
    the mechanisms by which transcription factors (TFs) regulate cell type identity
    have remained largely obscure. Through comparative analysis of 10 key haematopoietic
    TFs in both mast cells and blood progenitors, we demonstrate that the largely
    cell type-specific binding profiles are not opportunistic, but instead contribute
    to cell type-specific transcriptional control, because (i) mathematical modelling
    of differential binding of shared TFs can explain differential gene expression,
    (ii) consensus binding sites are important for cell type-specific binding and
    (iii) knock-down of blood stem cell regulators in mast cells reveals mast cell-specific
    genes as direct targets. Finally, we show that the known mast cell regulators
    Mitf and c-fos likely contribute to the global reorganisation of TF binding profiles.
    Taken together therefore, our study elucidates how key regulatory TFs contribute
    to transcriptional programmes in several distinct mammalian cell types.

  abstract: Motif finding is a difficult problem that has been studied for over 20
    years. Some older popular motif finders are not suitable for analysis of the large
    data sets generated by next-generation sequencing. We recently published an efficient
    approximation (STEME) to the EM algorithm that is at the core of many motif finders
    such as MEME. This approximation allows the EM algorithm to be applied to large
    data sets. In this work we describe several efficient extensions to STEME that
    are based on the MEME algorithm. Together with the original STEME EM approximation,
    these extensions make STEME a fully-fledged motif finder with similar properties
    to MEME. We discuss the difficulty of objectively comparing motif finders. We
    show that STEME performs comparably to existing prominent discriminative motif
    finders, DREME and Trawler, on 13 sets of transcription factor binding data in
    mouse ES cells. We demonstrate the ability of STEME to find long degenerate motifs
    which these discriminative motif finders do not find. As part of our method, we
    extend an earlier method due to Nagarajan et al. for the efficient calculation
    of motif E-values. STEME’s source code is available under an open source license
    and STEME is available via a web interface.

  container-title: J R Soc Interface
  page: '20120525'
  volume: '10'
  issue: '78'
  abstract: A population of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells is characterized by a
    distribution of Nanog, a gene whose expression is associated with the degree of
    pluripotency. Cells exhibiting high levels of Nanog maintain a state of pluripotency,
    while those with low levels are more likely to undergo differentiation. Using
    a cell line with a fluorescence tag for Nanog enables measurements of the distribution
    of Nanog in an ES cell culture in a stationary state or after a perturbation.
    In order to model the dynamics of the system, we assume that the distribution
    of Nanog-GFP for single cells shows distinct attractor steady states of Nanog
    levels, with individual cells moving between these states stochastically. The
    addition of synthetic inhibitors of signal transduction induces strong shifts
    in the distribution of Nanog. In particular, the addition of Chiron and PD03,
    inhibitors for the ERK and GSK3 signalling pathways, induces a high level of Nanog.
    In this study, we placed ES cells in different culture conditions, including the
    above inhibitors, and recorded the change in Nanog-GFP distribution over several
    days. In order to interpret the measurements of Nanog levels, we propose a new
    stochastic modelling strategy for the dynamics of the system not requiring detailed
    knowledge of regulatory or signalling mechanisms, while still capturing the stochastic
    and the deterministic components of the stochastic dynamical system. Despite its
    relative simplicity, the model provides an insight into key features of the cell
    population under various conditions, including the level of noise and occupancy
    and location of attractor steady states, without the need for strong assumptions
    about the underlying cellular mechanisms. By applying the model to our experimental
    data, we infer the existence of three stable steady states for Nanog levels, which
    are the same in all the different conditions of the cell-culture medium. Noise,
    on the other hand, and the proportion of cells in each steady state are subject
    to large shifts. Surprisingly, the isolated effects of PD03 and Chiron on noise
    and dynamics of the system are quite different from their combined effect. Our
    results show that signalling determines the occupancy of each state, with a particular
    role for GSK3 in the regulation of the noise across the population.

  page: 'e41018'
  volume: '7'
  issue: '7'
  abstract: It has been suggested that pathway analysis can complement single-SNP
    analysis in exploring genomewide association data. Pathway analysis incorporates
    the available biological knowledge of genes and SNPs and is expected to improve
    the chances of revealing the underlying genetic architecture of complex traits.
    Methods for pathway analysis can be classified as competitive (enrichment) or
    self-contained (association) according to the hypothesis tested. Although association
    tests are statistically more powerful than enrichment tests they can be difficult
    to calibrate because biases in analysis accumulate across multiple SNPs or genes.
    Furthermore, enrichment tests can be more scientifically relevant than association
    tests, as they detect pathways with relatively more evidence for association than
    the remaining genes. Here we show how some well known association tests can be
    simply adapted to test for enrichment, and compare their performance to some established
    enrichment tests. We propose versions of the Adaptive Rank Truncated Product (ARTP),
    Tail Strength Measure and Fisher’s combination of p-values for testing the enrichment
    null hypothesis. We compare the behaviour of these proposed methods with the established
    Hypergeometric Test and Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The results of the
    simulation study show that the modified version of the ARTP method has generally
    the best performance across the situations considered. The methods were also applied
    for finding enriched pathways for body mass index (BMI) and platelet function
    phenotypes. The pathway analysis of BMI identified the Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide
    pathway as significantly associated with BMI. This pathway has been previously
    reported as associated with BMI and the risk of obesity. The ARTP method was the
    method that identified the largest number of enriched pathways across all tested
    pathway databases and phenotypes. The simulation and data application results
    are in agreement with previous work on association tests and suggests that the
    ARTP should be preferred for both enrichment and association testing.

  abstract: MEME and many other popular motif finders use the expectation-maximization
    (EM) algorithm to optimize their parameters. Unfortunately, the running time of
    EM is linear in the length of the input sequences. This can prohibit its application
    to data sets of the size commonly generated by high-throughput biological techniques.
    A suffix tree is a data structure that can efficiently index a set of sequences.
    We describe an algorithm, Suffix Tree EM for Motif Elicitation (STEME), that approximates
    EM using suffix trees. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application
    of suffix trees to EM. We provide an analysis of the expected running time of
    the algorithm and demonstrate that STEME runs an order of magnitude more quickly
    than the implementation of EM used by MEME. We give theoretical bounds for the
    quality of the approximation and show that, in practice, the approximation has
    a negligible effect on the outcome. We provide an open source implementation of
    the algorithm that we hope will be used to speed up existing and future motif
    search algorithms.

  abstract: DosR is an important regulator of the response to stress such as limited
    oxygen availability in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Time course gene expression
    data enable us to dissect this response on the gene regulatory level. The mRNA
    expression profile of a regulator, however, is not necessarily a direct reflection
    of its activity. Knowing the transcription factor activity (TFA) can be exploited
    to predict novel target genes regulated by the same transcription factor. Various
    approaches have been proposed to reconstruct TFAs from gene expression data. Most
    of them capture only a first-order approximation to the complex transcriptional
    processes by assuming linear gene responses and linear dynamics in TFA, or ignore
    the temporal information in data from such systems.

  abstract: 'Classically, models of DNA-transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs)
    have been based on relatively few known instances and have treated them as sites
    of fixed length using position weight matrices (PWMs). Various extensions to this
    model have been proposed, most of which take account of dependencies between the
    bases in the binding sites. However, some transcription factors are known to exhibit
    some flexibility and bind to DNA in more than one possible physical configuration.
    In some cases this variation is known to affect the function of binding sites.
    With the increasing volume of ChIP-seq data available it is now possible to investigate
    models that incorporate this flexibility. Previous work on variable length models

  abstract: Transcriptional regulation is an important part of regulatory control
    in eukaryotes. Even if binding motifs for transcription factors are known, the
    task of finding binding sites by scanning sequences is plagued by false positives.
    One way to improve the detection of binding sites from motifs is by taking cooperativity
    of transcription factor binding into account. We propose a non-parametric probabilistic
    model, similar to a document topic model, for detecting transcriptional programs,
    groups of cooperative transcription factors and co-regulated genes. The analysis
    results in transcriptional programs which generalise both transcriptional modules
    and TF-target gene incidence matrices and provide a higher-level summary of these
    structures. The method is independent of prior specification of training sets
    of genes, for example, via gene expression data. The analysis is based on known
    binding motifs.

  container-title: Mol. Biol. Evol.
  page: '451-61'
  volume: '26'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Natural selection on codon usage is a pervasive force that acts on a large
    variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Despite this, obtaining reliable
    estimates of selection on codon usage has proved complicated, perhaps due to the
    fact that the selection coefficients involved are very small. In this work, a
    population genetics model is used to measure the strength of selected codon usage
    bias, S, in 10 eukaryotic genomes. It is shown that the strength of selection
    is closely linked to expression and that reliable estimates of selection coefficients
    can only be obtained for genes with very similar expression levels. We compare
    the strength of selected codon usage for orthologous genes across all 10 genomes
    classified according to expression categories. Fungi genomes present the largest
    S values (2.24-2.56), whereas multicellular invertebrate and plant genomes present
    more moderate values (0.61-1.91). The large mammalian genomes (human and mouse)
    show low S values (0.22-0.51) for the most highly expressed genes. This might
    not be evidence for selection in these organisms as the technique used here to
    estimate S does not properly account for nucleotide composition heterogeneity
    along such genomes. The relationship between estimated S values and empirical
    estimates of population size is presented here for the first time. It is shown,
    as theoretically expected, that population size has an important role in the operativity
    of translational selection.

  container-title: EURASIP J Bioinform Syst Biol
  page: '172840'
  abstract: Two-level gene regulatory networks consist of the transcription factors
    (TFs) in the top level and their regulated genes in the second level. The expression
    profiles of the regulated genes are the observed high-throughput data given by
    experiments such as microarrays. The activity profiles of the TFs are treated
    as hidden variables as well as the connectivity matrix that indicates the regulatory
    relationships of TFs with their regulated genes. Factor analysis (FA) as well
    as other methods, such as the network component algorithm, has been suggested
    for reconstructing gene regulatory networks and also for predicting TF activities.
    They have been applied to E. coli and yeast data with the assumption that these
    datasets consist of identical and independently distributed samples. Thus, the
    main drawback of these algorithms is that they ignore any time correlation existing
    within the TF profiles. In this paper, we extend previously studied FA algorithms
    to include time correlation within the transcription factors. At the same time,
    we consider connectivity matrices that are sparse in order to capture the existing
    sparsity present in gene regulatory networks. The TFs activity profiles obtained
    by this approach are significantly smoother than profiles from previous FA algorithms.
    The periodicities in profiles from yeast expression data become prominent in our
    reconstruction. Moreover, the strength of the correlation between time points
    is estimated and can be used to assess the suitability of the experimental time
    interval.

  abstract: Most existing algorithms for the inference of the structure of gene regulatory
    networks from gene expression data assume that the activity levels of transcription
    factors (TFs) are proportional to their mRNA levels. This assumption is invalid
    for most biological systems. However, one might be able to reconstruct unobserved
    activity profiles of TFs from the expression profiles of target genes. A simple
    model is a two-layer network with unobserved TF variables in the first layer and
    observed gene expression variables in the second layer. TFs are connected to regulated
    genes by weighted edges. The weights, known as factor loadings, indicate the strength
    and direction of regulation. Of particular interest are methods that produce sparse
    networks, networks with few edges, since it is known that most genes are regulated
    by only a small number of TFs, and most TFs regulate only a small number of genes.

  abstract: 'Whole genome DNA microarray genomotyping experiments compare the gene

    good convergence properties. Error rates are reduced compared with approaches
    that ignore spatial information. Moreover, the HMM circumvents a problem encountered
    in a conventional analysis: determining the cut-off value to use to classify a

    the benefit of users unfamiliar with R. The application may be found at http://hmmgd.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/hmmgd.

  abstract: Transfer RNA genes tend to be presented in multiple copies in the genomes
    of most organisms, from bacteria to eukaryotes. The evolution and genomic structure
    of tRNA genes has been a somewhat neglected area of molecular evolution. Escherichia
    coli, the first phylogenetic species for which more than two different strains
    have been sequenced, provides an invaluable framework to study the evolution of
    tRNA genes. In this work, a detailed analysis of the tRNA structure of the genomes
    of Escherichia coli strains K12, CFT073, and O157:H7, Shigella flexneri 2a 301,
    and Salmonella typhimurium LT2 was carried out. A phylogenetic analysis of these
    organisms was completed, and an archaeological map depicting the main events in
    the evolution of tRNA genes was drawn. It is shown that duplications, deletions,
    and horizontal gene transfers are the main factors driving tRNA evolution in these
    genomes. On average, 0.64 tRNA insertions/duplications occur every million years
    (Myr) per genome per lineage, while deletions occur at the slower rate of 0.30
    per million years per genome per lineage. This work provides a first genomic glance
    at the problem of tRNA evolution as a repetitive process, and the relationship
    of this mechanism to genome evolution and codon usage is discussed.

  volume: '32'
  issue: '17'
  abstract: Translational selection is responsible for the unequal usage of synonymous
    codons in protein coding genes in a wide variety of organisms. It is one of the
    most subtle and pervasive forces of molecular evolution, yet, establishing the
    underlying causes for its idiosyncratic behaviour across living kingdoms has proven
    elusive to researchers over the past 20 years. In this study, a statistical model
    for measuring translational selection in any given genome is developed, and the
    test is applied to 126 fully sequenced genomes, ranging from archaea to eukaryotes.
    It is shown that tRNA gene redundancy and genome size are interacting forces that
    ultimately determine the action of translational selection, and that an optimal
    genome size exists for which this kind of selection is maximal. Accordingly, genome
    size also presents upper and lower boundaries beyond which selection on codon
    usage is not possible. We propose a model where the coevolution of genome size
    and tRNA genes explains the observed patterns in translational selection in all
    living organisms. This model finally unifies our understanding of codon usage
    across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Helicobacter pylori, Saccharomyces cerevisiae
    and Homo sapiens are codon usage paradigms that can be better understood under
    the proposed model.

  abstract: 'Escherichia coli has long been regarded as a model organism in the

    this topic have been computational or, when experimental, restricted to small
    datasets; particularly poor attention has been given to genes with low CUB. In
    this work, correspondence analysis on codon usage is used to classify E.coli genes
    into three groups, and the relationship between them and expression levels from
    microarray experiments is studied. These groups are: group 1, highly biased genes;
    group 2, moderately biased genes; and group 3, AT-rich genes with low CUB. It
    is shown that, surprisingly, there is a negative correlation between codon bias
    and expression levels for group 3 genes, i.e. genes with extremely low codon adaptation
    index (CAI) values are highly expressed, while group 2 show the lowest average
    expression levels and group 1 show the usual expected positive correlation between
    CAI and expression. This trend is maintained over all functional gene groups,
    seeming to contradict the E.coli-yeast paradigm on CUB. It is argued that these
    findings are still compatible with the mutation-selection balance hypothesis of
    codon usage and that E.coli genes form a dynamic system shaped by these factors.'

  abstract: An automatic protein design procedure is used to select amino acid sequences
    that optimize the folding free energy function for a given protein. The only information
    used in designing the sequences is a set of known backbone structures for each
    protein, a rotamer library, and a well established classical empirical force field,
    which relies on basic physical chemical principles that underlie molecular interactions
    and protein stability, and has not been adjusted to yield native-like sequences.
    Applying the procedure to 7 different known protein folds, representing a total
    of 45 different native protein structures, yields ensembles of designed sequences
    displaying remarkable similarity to their natural counterparts in the protein
    core, but which are distinctly non-native on the protein surface. We show that
    natural and designed sequences for a given fold score significantly higher than
    random sequences against profiles derived from both, designed and natural sequence
    ensembles. Furthermore, we find that designed sequence profiles can be used to
    retrieve the native sequences for many of the analyzed proteins using standard
    PSI-BLAST searches in sequence databases. These findings may have important implications
    for our understanding the selection pressures operating on natural protein sequences
    and hold promise for improving fold recognition.
